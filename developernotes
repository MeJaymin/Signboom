Changes
in Signboom_offcuts table default value table was expecting while inserting any values then it was expecting default value for date so I have changed the code and added date in code itself in create-offcut.php

Ask jennifer for demo pdf files


Issues
When I am in ready queue and I am confirming one order while in live it goes to different queues and while in local i found code bug. Need to test it

While In Files Queue date is not cmimh properly and also Options are coming in checkboxes instead of Name of Queue


While in production logout is not working from before


build_message.php-- I have changed awhole lot of code here..for file uploading


Doubts - After FIle uploading, does mail really works here?
Doubts _ I have not test confirmation email section as we already have
seperate tasks for confirmation email, as of now I just have kept the older version
----
Doubts - In pdw/dashboard.php, what I found is I have commented one line of including file, that file he is including is probably not there.
While in same file date_picker was also not ther I have copied from production includes folder.

Completed so far
admin done
